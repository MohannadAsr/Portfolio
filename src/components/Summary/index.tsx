        Hi! I’m a passionate Web Developer with a strong focus on front-end
        development, though I’m also diving into back-end work. I hold a
        Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications and Electronics Engineering,
        which gives me a solid technical foundation that I bring to every
        project. I love creating stylish and responsive websites that not only
        look great but also offer an amazing user experience. I’m always eager
        to learn new technologies and push my skills further, aiming to deliver
        web solutions that truly stand out.
